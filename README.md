## Description

This is our final project, and we did our best to bring together everything we have learned over the course.

This application involves user authentication, MongoDB database storage including Model relationships, allows user interaction via CRUD operations, stores encrypted passwords, uses an external API, is made using ReactJS, utilizes a Node and Express server, hides sensitive API key information, and more.

We're very happy with what we managed to achieve with this app! There is still plenty of room for growth, but we achieved what we set out to accomplish and even some stretch goals.

## UserStory
As a music enthusiast, I want to build playlists based my taste in music so that I can create a playlist for every occasion.

## ElevatorPitch
This application is made for users to be able to create their own playlists with curated video choices from the youtube API to watch.

## APIsAndTechnologies
These are the API's and technologies that we used that we have not discussed previously:
- Youtube API
- connect-mongo
- googleapis
- he
- react-youtube

## Installation

Files must be downloaded from Github. Then run npm install to get the necessary node modules. Lastly run npm start.


## Usage

With this application, a user can create custom playlists and view the videos in their playlists on the playlist page. They can search for videos on the search page. After done for the day, users can log out via the logout button in the navbar, or they will be logged out automatically after 12 hours.
